### ReShadeFX vs SweetFX

[ReShadeFX should be preferred](https://www.reddit.com/r/sweetfx/comments/3aafg7/what_is_the_difference_between_sweetfx_and_reshade/) in order to apply shaders to your game, it's no a cheat but some AV programs flagging it because it injects some code into the executable file in order to apply the filter (which you can choose or code on your own). ReShade is well known and does work for D3D9, D3D10, D3D11 and OpenGL based games just fine. This is not banned in eSports.
